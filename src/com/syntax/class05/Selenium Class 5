Handling Checkboxes and Radiobuttons:
--if you have only 1 checkbox or radiobutton, you can just click on it.
--if you have multiple choices, store them in List and loop through

(checkboxes- you can check/select multiple buttons vs. radio button you can only select 1)

Drop Downs:
--dropdown is a menu which gives us an opportunity to select one or more options

Types of Dropdowns:
1. Single select
2. Multiple select

Handling Dropdowns:
1. Click on dropdown and click on the option
2.using select class
        in order to use select class we need to make sure our dropdown has select tag

Selecting an option from a dropdown can be done in 3 ways:
1. by index
2. visible text
3. value



Whenever you interact with multiple elements, you store them inside the container sucha s List, Set, etc.
