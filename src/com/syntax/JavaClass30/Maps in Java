Maps in Java:
--Map is an interface that allows us to store the data in key value pairs.

Benefits:
-- 1. we can store two values inside maps.
--2. Searching is very efficient in maps

Types of Maps:
1. HashMap
2. LinkedHashMap
3. TreeMap

Hashmap:
--insertion order is not maintained (downside)
--insertion and retrieval is fastest (upside)

LinkedHashMap:
--insertion order is maintained(upside)
--insertion speed is same as HashMap but retrieval speed is slowest in all maps

TreeMap
--Data is sorted in natural order by default.
--insertion speed is slowest but retrieval speed is better than LinkedHashMap but slower than Hashmap

Rules:
-- We cannot convert a collection to a map for example we can;t convert a set to a Map
-- Duplicate keys are not allowed in maps
--Duplicate values are allowed


Map <String, String> students =  new Map<>()
students.put("Yaz123", "Yazgul");
Set <String> set = new HashSet (students)
