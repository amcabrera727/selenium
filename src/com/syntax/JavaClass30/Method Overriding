Method Overriding in java;
Method overriding happens when we have same method names with same signature (Method name and its parameter are
called signature of a method) in a parent class and in a child class

Benefits:
1) flexibility, with the help of method overriding child classes can provide its own implementation
of the methods that are present in the parent class
Polymorphism- same method can behave differently depending upon the object we call it

Rules:
1) There must me Parent- Child relationship between the two classes
2) The method that we are trying override must be present inside the child class with same name and parameters
3)  if something doesn't participate in inheritance we can't override it for example private methods and fields and constructors
4) if a method is declared final inside the parent class we can't override that method inside the child class
5) we can't override the static methods but, we can redeclare them. for example the main method.
------we can overload the main method but can't override it, we can also re-declare the main method----
6) we can't change the access modifier to be more restrictive
7) Method return type should be the same

Method Overloading                       vs.            Method Overriding
-- Method signature should be different                 --Method Signature should be the same
--Return type can be different                          --return type should be the same
--we don't care about the access modifiers              --access modifiers can't be more restrictive
--we don't care about the non access modifiers           -- we do care about the non access modifiers
    (final static abstract)
--We can overload constructors                          --we can't override constructors
--we achieve compile time or static binding             --run time polymorphism or dynamic binding
  or early binding or static polymorphism
