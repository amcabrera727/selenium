WHAT IS A WEB ELEMENT?
-Anything we see on a webpage(text, button, text box, images, etc)

DOM (Document Object Model)- It is the browsers internal view of the webpage
Also called as Developer's tools or Dev Tools

DOCUMENT--> can be stored any document such as pdf, excel, etc.
OBJECT--> any line in HTML is considered as Object
MODEL--> layout of the HTML

Locator - an address or a position of a webelement on the web
page is used to locate or identify webelements on the web page

8 locators:
-ID
-Name
-TagName
-xpath
-linkText
-PartialLinkText
-CSS Selector
-Classname

HTML Scripting Meaning:
purple--> tags|| button, input, div
brown--> attribute || name, class, id
blue--> attribute value ||


Why do we need many locators?
--> developers say not to provide all the locators for all the elements
-->Some locators may have duplicate values in different nodes
--> some locators may not be applicable for the elements we are looking for
e.g. lintText and partialLinkText are only used for links

"a" tag is also called an anchor tag

If 2 or more elements have same attributes and attributes value,
Selenium will only interact with the first element it locates




name , ID, and class= locators and attributes inside HTML
