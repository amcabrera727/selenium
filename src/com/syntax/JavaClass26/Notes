Abstraction in JAVA:
Hiding the implementation details and providing the functionality only
Two methods to achieve abstractions:
1. Abstract classes
2. Interfaces

Abstract classes: Abstract classes are classes with abstract keyword.
Interfaces: Interfaces are the contracts that we create with the help of interface keyword.

How to decide which one to use?
1. prefer the interfaces over the abstract classes.
2. if two or more classes are closely related to each other, go with abstract classes.
    for example, if we have to create a Lion class and a Horse class we should go with abstract
    classes and should create an animal abstract class.
    -if two classes are not related to each other for example an Apple and a cloth, we should
    create an interface for that. If we want to have a behavior washAble
