Selenium Class 7

Handling Multiple Windows(tabs):
--in order to handle multiple windows we will be using:
    --getWindowHandle();
    --getWindowHandles();

WindowHandle:
--Is a unique ID that holds the address of the window or a tab
--it is approximately a 40 alphanumeric character ID

Synchronization:
--the process of bringing the speed of two or more components the same level
-in this case we are bringing out script and page load to the same speed level

Thread.sleep() --static wait / unconditional wait

Types of Selenium Waits:
-implicit wait
-explicit wait
-fluent wait

Implicit Wait:
-- it tells the webdriver to wait for a certain amount of time before throwing an exception
-- it will only be written once and will be applied to the whole session of the execution
--We can say that implicit wait is a global wait

Implicit wait works with findElement() method

Implicit wait is usually 20 seconds. If your element is found in any time between the given time
the remaining time will be ignored and your script will move on to the next line or action

If the element is not found in a given time, ONLY then you will get an exception
