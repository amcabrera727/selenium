Alerts:
--Alert is a pop-up message. Alert takes a complete focus of our main page
  that we are working on and we cannot proceed until it is handled.

Types of Alerts:
1. Web based Alerts/ HTML alerts-- we can simply inspect and perform needed actions
2. Javascript Alert / Browser Alerts -- we can handle these alerts by using switchTo method
                                     --we cannot inspect any of the javascript alerts
3. Windows Based Alerts -- we cannot handle with Selenium



Types of JS(javascript):
1. Simple Alert - click OK
2. Confirmation Alert -- either cancel or click OK
3. Prompt Alert -- enter the text and then click OK or cancel



To handle JS alerts we only have 4 methods:
1. accept() - click OK
2. dismiss() - click cancel
3. getText()
4. sendKeys()


To handle authentication alerts we need to pass username and password in the URL

https://admin:admin@the-internet.herokuapp.com/basic_auth
        //username:password@

Frames:
--Frames is a separate independent window in out webpage
--Frames allow devs to represent multiple views on one page

3 ways to interact with Frames:
1. by index
2. by name or ID
3. by WebElement

in alerts- switch to alert and switch automatically back
in frames- switch to a frame manually and switch manually back to the main page

Interview question: How do you handle alerts?
--we handle alerts by using alert interface
